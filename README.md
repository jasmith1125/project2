**Description:** This project demonstrates that I have learned how to use basic PHP to create and deploy an xkcd-style password generator. 

**Details for teaching team:**  
My customized CSS is in the project folder: css/app.css; this validates via WC3 standards.  

My PHP file is logic.php (in document root). This follows the FAQ Section project 2 demo Pat did on 9/23.

I interpreted the project to include a "landing page" for information/marketing and a separate page for the password generator. Both pages validate via WC3 HTML standards. I tried to make the generator as user friendly as possible by including the following features:  
1. Dropdown to make selecting optimal number of words easy.   
2. PHP added to keep checkbox checked if user selects.  
3. Link back to information about xkcd passwords (and link to the comic that explains the evolution of this password style).

**Outside code:**
